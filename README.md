Gambit Challenge

To be able to parse the register into human readable data I created a C# script that reads the register and parse it based on what data type it is.

To be able to display the data I made a mobile application with Unity3D. The UI is really simple, just a scrollview and a button for refreshing the data list.

Android Studio project files and Android APK are provided so it can be tested on your own android phone.


Unity3D source code also included

Note!
There are still issues with INTEGER and BCD datatype.
